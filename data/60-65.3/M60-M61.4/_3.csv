M61.2,"10. Patient underwent surgery to address paralytic calcification, ossification of the left quadriceps muscle, and bone erosion of the femur. The surgical team excised the calcified masses, reconstructed the muscle, and performed bone grafting to address the bone erosion. Post-operative assessments confirmed successful removal of calcifications, improved muscle function, and stabilization of the eroded bone.",Paralytic calcification and ossification of muscle ,"10.

M61.3,"Operative Note 15: Surgical intervention was performed to address burn-induced muscle calcification and ossification. A modified transverse incision was made, providing excellent exposure to the affected muscles. Thorough excision of calcified and ossified tissues was meticulously performed. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery and meticulous surgical technique. The wound was closed in layers, and the patient was referred for postoperative rehabilitation to optimize muscle functionality.",Calcification and ossification of muscles associated with burns ,"Running Note 15: Surgical intervention was performed to address burn - induced muscle calcification and ossification.
