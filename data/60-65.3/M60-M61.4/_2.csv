M60.0,"3. This operative note documents the surgical management of mild infective myositis involving the right adductor muscles. The procedure was performed under spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine (10 mg) injected at the L3-L4 interspace. A medial approach was utilized, allowing for drainage of purulent material and limited debridement. Cultures confirmed the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Thorough irrigation was performed, and the wound was closed primarily. Intravenous antibiotics targeting MRSA were administered. The patient's follow-up will involve a postoperative visit to assess wound healing and response to antibiotics.",Infective myositis ,"3.
