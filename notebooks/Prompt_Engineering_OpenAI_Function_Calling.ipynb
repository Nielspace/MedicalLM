        "        The patient was given 2 grams of IV Ancef, IV piggyback, prior to coming back to the operating room. Once he was back, he was transferred from the OR stretcher onto the operating table without complication. After induction of general anesthesia, LMA was placed by the anesthesia department. A well-padded tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the left thigh. The entire left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion with a double DuraPrep scrub. Routine sterile draping technique was used. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the left lower extremity prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 300 mmHg. A double DuraPrep scrub was performed. Routine sterile draping technique was used. The patient was brought into the laminar flow room and laminar flow garb was worn by all operating room personnel. A midline incision was made over the left knee. Medial and lateral flaps were developed. The medial parapatellar approach was used to enter the knee joint. The anteromedial takedown was performed about the anteromedial tibia. The patella was everted. The knee was fully flexed and the retropatellar fat pad was excised. The anterior cruciate ligament was transected. A 9.5 drillbit was used to open up the distal femoral canal. A long intermedullary rod was placed. A 5-degree valgus alignment position was used. The distal cutting block was pinned in appropriated alignment. The distal cut was made taking 10-12 mm of bone off the distal femur. The raw surface of the distal femur was sized to be a size #7. A size #7, 4-in-1 cutting block was pinned in neutral rotation. Anterior and posterior cuts were made and then anterior and posterior chamfer cuts were made in a routine fashion with an oscillating saw.\n",
        "        The patella was then evaluated and 2 Lewin clamps were used to stabilize the patella. Freehand oscillating saw cut was made in the patella, taking 10 mm of bone from the raw surface of the patella sized to be at #35. A #35 template was placed in the superomedial position. Drill holes were made and a #35 patella trial was placed. Two Homans were used to expose the tibia, one posterior and one lateral. The mediolateral meniscus was excised. All bleeding points were controlled with cautery. A 9.5 drill bit was used to open the tibial canal. A long intermedullary rod was placed down the canal. Proximal tibial cutting block was pinned. A cut was made perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia and 10 mm of bone was taken off the high side laterally and about 2 mm medially. The cut was made, the raw surface of the tibia sized to be at size #7. All osteophytes were removed from the posterior femur with an osteotome and mallet. A size #7 tibial trial was placed with a trial #11 deep-dish liner and a trial #7 femoral component. The knee was reduced and taken through a full range of motion. There was mild tightness to the medial structures and a medial release was performed of the pes anserine tendon. The instability was equal with valgus and varus stress in both full extension and full flexion. All trial components were removed. Copious amount of normal saline was used to irrigate all the raw bony surfaces. A cement restrictor was placed down the tibial canal about 4 cm. Two packets of the DePuy 1 cement were mixed on the back table.\n",
        "        Once the cement was in its doughy state, it was infiltrated in the tibial canal and on the tibial plateau surface. A final size #7 tibial component was impacted into place. Excess cement was removed with a Freer elevator. The final size #11 deep-dish polyethylene liner was impacted into the tibial tray until it was fully seated. Cement was then coated on the raw surface of the femur, and the final size #7 Oxinium femoral component was impacted into place and excess cement was removed with a Freer elevator. The knee was taken out to a fully extended position. The cement was coated on the raw surface of the patella, and the final size #35 patella button was placed and held with a patella clamp. Excess cement was removed with a Freer elevator. Once the cement was fully hardened, the tourniquet was deflated after 44 minutes. All bleeding points were controlled with cautery. There was 150 cc of blood loss. The deep fascia was closed over a ConstaVac Stryker drain. There was normal patellofemoral tracking and full range of motion of the knee with excellent stability. The deep fascia was closed with interrupted #0 Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted inverted #2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples. Dressings were placed with Xeroform, 4 x 4, ABD, and soft bulky dressing with double 6-inch Ace bandage and a cold pack. After reversal of general anesthesia, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition.\n",
